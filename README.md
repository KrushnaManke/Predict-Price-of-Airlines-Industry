## Predict-Price-of-Airlines-Industry
 The project commences with a succinct introduction to the business problem and dataset, providing a concise overview of the datasets and resources within just over a minute. Following this, the data undergoes a thorough preprocessing phase, featuring a detailed, step-by-step process of extracting derived features and performing data cleaning. The project then delves into data analysis, examining the impact of duration on price and conducting bi-variate analysis.

  In the domain of feature encoding, the project covers various techniques, including one-hot encoding, target-guided encoding, and manual label encoding. It also addresses critical tasks such as handling outliers and selecting the optimal features through robust feature selection methodologies.

  The complexities of decision trees are meticulously detailed across multiple sections to ensure comprehensive understanding. Linear regression is systematically demystified in a three-part series, followed by an extensive exploration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in four parts. The project concludes with insightful discussions on automating the machine learning pipeline, understanding cross-validation, and effectively hyper-tuning machine learning models.

  This journey equips me with the essential knowledge and skills required to address real-world data science challenges, rendering the project a comprehensive and practical guide from inception to completion.
